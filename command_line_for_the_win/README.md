## command_line_for_the_win

command_line_for_the_win is the directory with tasks that test my knowledge of using sftp to transfer files from local machine to remote machine. These are the steps I took to transfer the 3 files(including all otehr tasks):

##### I opened terminal on my windows machine.
#####Secondly, I navigated to where my screenshots were and after confirming I could see them on my local machine, I proceeded.
#####I typed the sftp command together with my username and hostname. (sftp username@hostname)
#####I was prompted for password and there after I was authenticated and I got the sftp prompt.
#####I tried a number of commands like 'pwd, lpwd, ls, lls' just for testing.
#####I used the 'cd' command to navigate to the directory on the remote machine where I wanted to upload the files.
#####I used the 'put' command to upload the files. (put 'filename')
